# Branch Protection Test

This file tests the branch protection and auto-merge system.

## Test Results

- ✅ Branch protection enabled
- ✅ Auto-merge workflow created
- ✅ PR template in place
- ✅ CODEOWNERS configured
- ✅ Contributing guide available

## Expected Behavior

1. This PR should trigger CI/CD pipeline
2. After approval, auto-merge should activate
3. PR will be squash-merged automatically
4. Feature branch will be cleaned up

## Verification

The main branch is now protected and requires:
- Pull request review (minimum 1 approval)
- All CI checks must pass
- No direct pushes to main
- No force pushes allowed
