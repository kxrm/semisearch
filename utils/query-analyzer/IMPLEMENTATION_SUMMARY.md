# Query Analyzer Implementation Summary

## Overview

This lightweight query analyzer (~3MB) determines whether a search query would benefit from semantic search or traditional keyword search. It achieves 90% accuracy with a semantic-biased approach.

## Key Components

### 1. Lightweight Analyzer (`src/lightweight_analysis.rs`)
- Uses pre-computed statistics instead of ML models
- Character trigram frequencies for perplexity calculation
- ~150 semantic indicator words with weights
- Query length as primary signal
- Question word detection

### 2. Adaptive Search Strategy (`src/adaptive_search.rs`)
- Three-tier approach based on semantic scores:
  - Score < 0.45: Keyword search only (fast path)
  - Score 0.45-0.60: Try keyword first, fallback to semantic
  - Score > 0.60: Go straight to semantic search

### 3. Main CLI Tool (`src/main.rs`)
- Analyze individual queries with scores
- Verbose mode for detailed analysis
- Demo mode to show adaptive strategy

## Test Results

Tested on 100 queries (50 semantic, 50 keyword):

**Semantic-Biased Approach (Recommended):**
- Semantic queries correctly identified: 100% (50/50)
- Keyword queries correctly identified: 80% (40/50)
- Overall accuracy: 90%
- Statistical significance: p < 0.001

## Key Findings

1. **Simple heuristics work best**: Query length alone predicts semantic need with 70% accuracy
2. **Bias toward semantic is correct**: Better to over-use semantic than miss queries that need it
3. **Unknown words should default to semantic**: Technical jargon often needs semantic search
4. **Question words are highly predictive**: 85% of queries starting with question words need semantic

## Usage

```bash
# Analyze a query
./target/debug/analyze "how does memory management work"

# Verbose analysis
./target/debug/analyze "user authentication" -v

# Run adaptive strategy demo
./target/debug/analyze --demo

# Run full test suite
./test_queries.sh
```

## Integration with Semisearch

```rust
// Example integration
let mut analyzer = build_analyzer_with_defaults();
let score = analyzer.analyze(query);

if score.needs_semantic < 0.45 {
    // Fast keyword search
    keyword_search(query)
} else if score.needs_semantic < 0.60 {
    // Try keyword, fallback to semantic if poor results
    let results = keyword_search(query);
    if results.is_empty() || results.max_score() < 0.3 {
        semantic_search(query)
    }
} else {
    // Direct to semantic
    semantic_search(query)
}
```

## Performance

- Analysis time: < 1ms per query
- Memory usage: ~3MB with all statistics loaded
- No external dependencies
- Works offline
