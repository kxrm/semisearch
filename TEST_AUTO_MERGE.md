# Auto-merge Test

This is a test PR to verify that the auto-merge circular dependency fix works correctly.

The auto-merge workflow should now:
- ✅ Trigger after CI completion (workflow_run trigger)
- ✅ Not wait for itself (no circular dependency)
- ✅ Automatically merge when all CI checks pass

Testing the fix implemented in PR #4!

## Expected Behavior
1. CI/CD Pipeline runs and completes successfully
2. Auto-merge workflow triggers via workflow_run
3. PR gets automatically merged without waiting for itself
4. No more circular dependency issues!
