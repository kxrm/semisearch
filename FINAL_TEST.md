# Final Auto-merge Test

This is the final test to verify that both fixes work together:

1. âœ… Circular dependency fix (workflow_run trigger)
2. âœ… Syntax error fix (environment variables)

Expected result: This PR should auto-merge successfully!

## Summary of Fixes Applied:
- Fixed circular dependency by changing to workflow_run trigger
- Fixed syntax error by using environment variables for PR data
- Auto-merge should now work completely

Let's see the magic happen! ðŸš€
