# SemiSearch for Beginners

## What is SemiSearch?

SemiSearch helps you find text in your files, even when you don't remember the exact words. It's designed to be simple for beginners but grows with you as you learn.

## Basic Usage

Just type what you're looking for:
```bash
semisearch "what you want to find"
```

That's it! No configuration required.

## Examples

### Find TODO comments
```bash
semisearch "TODO"
```

### Find database-related code
```bash
semisearch "database"
```

### Find error handling
```bash
semisearch "error"
```

### Find function definitions
```bash
semisearch "function login"
```

### Search in specific places
```bash
semisearch "TODO" src/          # Search only in src/ directory
semisearch "config" config.json # Search in specific file
```

## When Things Go Wrong

### No results found?
SemiSearch will automatically suggest what to try:
```bash
semisearch "nonexistent"
# Shows helpful suggestions like:
# â€¢ Try different words
# â€¢ Check spelling with --fuzzy
# â€¢ Search in parent directories
```

Try:
- **Check spelling**: `semisearch "databse" --fuzzy` (finds "database")
- **Use simpler words**: `semisearch "login"` instead of `semisearch "authentication"`
- **Search everywhere**: `semisearch "your search" .`

### Too many results?
SemiSearch automatically gives you tips:
```bash
semisearch "function"
# Shows: "Many results found. Use more specific terms or search in specific folders"
```

Try:
- **Be more specific**: `semisearch "function validateUser"`
- **Search in specific folders**: `semisearch "TODO" src/`
- **Use exact phrases**: `semisearch "exact phrase" --exact`

### Still stuck?
Run: `semisearch help-me` for interactive help.

## Interactive Help

SemiSearch includes an interactive help system that guides you through common scenarios:

```bash
semisearch help-me
```

This will start an interactive session where you can:
- Type search queries and see examples
- Get personalized suggestions
- Learn about different search options
- Practice with real examples

The help system will guide you step by step and is perfect for learning.

## Simple Flags

### Handle typos and similar words
```bash
semisearch "databse" --fuzzy
```
This will find "database" even with the typo!

### Find exact matches only
```bash
semisearch "exact phrase" --exact
```

### Show more context around matches
```bash
semisearch "function" --context 2
```

### Get output as JSON (for scripts)
```bash
semisearch "config" --format json
```
