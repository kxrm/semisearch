# API Documentation

## Overview

This repository contains comprehensive documentation for our RESTful API. The API allows developers to interact with our platform programmatically, enabling integration with various applications and services.

## Getting Started

To get started with our API, you'll need:

1. An API key (sign up at [developer.example.com](https://developer.example.com))
2. Basic understanding of RESTful APIs and HTTP methods
3. A tool for making HTTP requests (like cURL, Postman, or any HTTP client library)

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using an API key. Include your API key in the request header:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Base URL

All API endpoints are relative to the base URL:

```
https://api.example.com/v1
```

## Response Format

All responses are returned in JSON format with the following structure:

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": { ... },
  "meta": { ... }
}
```

Or in case of an error:

```json
{
  "status": "error",
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Human-readable error message"
  }
}
```

## Rate Limiting

The API enforces rate limiting to ensure fair usage. Current limits are:

- 100 requests per minute for free tier
- 1000 requests per minute for premium tier

Rate limit information is included in response headers:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 95
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1620000000
```
