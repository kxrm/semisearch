# API Overview

Our API is designed with RESTful principles in mind, making it intuitive and easy to use. This section provides a high-level overview of the API architecture, design philosophy, and core concepts.

## Design Principles

The API follows these key design principles:

1. **RESTful Architecture**: Resources are represented as URLs, and standard HTTP methods are used to manipulate them.
2. **Stateless Communication**: Each request contains all the information needed to process it.
3. **JSON Everywhere**: All request and response bodies use JSON format.
4. **Consistent Error Handling**: Errors follow a standardized format across all endpoints.
5. **Versioning**: API versions are included in the URL path to ensure backward compatibility.

## Core Concepts

### Resources

The API organizes data into resources, each with a unique URL. For example:

- `/users` - User resources
- `/products` - Product resources
- `/orders` - Order resources

### HTTP Methods

Standard HTTP methods are used to interact with resources:

- `GET`: Retrieve resources
- `POST`: Create new resources
- `PUT`: Update existing resources (full update)
- `PATCH`: Update existing resources (partial update)
- `DELETE`: Remove resources

### Authentication

All API requests must be authenticated using an API key. See [Authentication](./authentication.md) for details.

### Pagination

List endpoints return paginated results to improve performance. Pagination parameters can be included in the query string:

```
GET /users?page=2&limit=20
```

Pagination metadata is included in the response:

```json
{
  "meta": {
    "pagination": {
      "total": 350,
      "pages": 18,
      "current_page": 2,
      "limit": 20
    }
  }
}
```

### Filtering and Sorting

Many endpoints support filtering and sorting:

```
GET /products?category=electronics&sort=price:desc
```

## API Sections

The API is organized into the following sections:

1. **User Management**: Create, update, and manage user accounts
2. **Product Catalog**: Access product information and inventory
3. **Order Processing**: Create and manage orders
4. **Payment Processing**: Handle payment transactions
5. **Analytics**: Retrieve usage statistics and reports

See the [Endpoints Reference](../endpoints/README.md) for detailed documentation on each endpoint.
