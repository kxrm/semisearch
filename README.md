# SemiSearch - Smart Local File Search

**Find what you're looking for in your files, even when you don't know the exact words.**

SemiSearch is a privacy-focused command-line tool that helps you search through your local files using natural language. Unlike traditional search tools that only match exact keywords, SemiSearch understands the *meaning* behind your search queries.

## What Makes SemiSearch Different?

### üß† **Semantic Understanding**
Traditional search tools look for exact word matches. If you search for "car", you won't find documents about "automobile" or "vehicle". SemiSearch understands that these words are related and finds them all.

**Example**: Searching for "error handling" will find:
- Code with try/catch blocks
- Documentation about exception management
- Comments mentioning "error recovery"
- Functions named "handleFailure" or "processException"

### üîí **100% Private**
Everything happens on your computer. No data is sent to the cloud. No AI services are called. Your files stay yours.

### ‚ö° **Works Everywhere**
SemiSearch adapts to your system:
- **High-end computer?** Uses advanced AI models for the best semantic understanding
- **Older laptop?** Falls back to statistical methods that still work great
- **Raspberry Pi?** Runs in lightweight mode with basic but effective search

## Quick Start

## Understanding Search Modes

SemiSearch offers different search strategies, each with its own strengths:

### üéØ **Semantic Search** (Recommended)
Understands meaning and context. Best for finding conceptually related content.

```bash
semisearch search "user authentication" --mode semantic
```

**When to use**: When you want to find all content related to a concept, even if it uses different words.

### üî§ **Keyword Search**
Traditional exact word matching. Fast and precise.

```bash
semisearch search "TODO" --mode keyword
```

**When to use**: When you know the exact text you're looking for.

### üîÄ **Fuzzy Search**
Handles typos and partial matches.

```bash
semisearch search "authentcation" --mode fuzzy
```

**When to use**: When you might have typos or only remember part of a word.

### üìê **Regex Search**
Pattern matching for complex searches.

```bash
semisearch search "user_[0-9]+" --mode regex
```

**When to use**: When you need to match patterns like email addresses, IDs, or structured text.

### üìä **TF-IDF Search**
Statistical ranking based on word importance.

```bash
semisearch search "machine learning" --mode tfidf
```

**When to use**: When you want results ranked by how important the search terms are in each document.

### üîÑ **Hybrid Search**
Combines semantic understanding with keyword matching for best results.

```bash
semisearch search "async error handling" --mode hybrid
```

**When to use**: When you want both exact matches and semantically related content.

## Common Use Cases

### For Developers

Find code examples and patterns:
```bash
# Find all error handling code
semisearch search "error handling try catch exception"

# Find async/await patterns
semisearch search "asynchronous programming" --mode semantic

# Find TODO comments with context
semisearch search "TODO|FIXME" --mode regex --context 2
```

### For Researchers

Search through papers and notes:
```bash
# Find content about a research topic
semisearch search "machine learning algorithms" --path ./research

# Find related concepts
semisearch search "neural networks" --mode semantic --score 0.3
```

### For Content Creators

Search through drafts and documents:
```bash
# Find all mentions of a topic across documents
semisearch search "climate change" --path ./articles

# Find similar paragraphs
semisearch search "renewable energy solutions" --mode semantic
```

## Advanced Features

### Indexing for Faster Searches

For large directories, create an index for instant searches:

```bash
# Create an index
semisearch index ./my-project

# Now searches are much faster
semisearch search "database queries"
```

### Fine-tuning Results

Control what results you see:

```bash
# Only show highly relevant results (0.0 to 1.0)
semisearch search "authentication" --score 0.7

# Limit number of results
semisearch search "user login" --limit 5

# Show surrounding context
semisearch search "password" --context 3
```

### System Capabilities

Check what search capabilities your system supports:

```bash
semisearch doctor
```

This shows:
- Available memory and processing power
- Whether AI models can be used
- Current search capabilities
- Recommendations for your system

## How Semantic Search Works

### In Simple Terms

Imagine you're looking for a book in a library:

1. **Traditional search**: You can only find books if you know the exact title
2. **Semantic search**: A librarian who understands what you're looking for and shows you related books

SemiSearch acts like that smart librarian for your files.

### The Technical Magic

1. **Text Understanding**: SemiSearch reads your files and understands what they're about
2. **Meaning Extraction**: It converts text into mathematical representations (called embeddings)
3. **Similarity Matching**: When you search, it finds files with similar meanings
4. **Smart Ranking**: Results are sorted by how closely they match your intent

### Privacy-First Approach

- **Local Processing**: All analysis happens on your computer
- **No Cloud Services**: Never sends your data anywhere
- **Offline Operation**: Works without internet (after initial setup)
- **Your Data Stays Yours**: No tracking, no analytics, no external APIs

## Installation Guide

1. Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/kxrm/semisearch/releases)
2. Download the binary for your system
3. Make it executable and run:

```bash
# Linux/macOS
chmod +x semisearch
./semisearch search "your query"

# Windows

```

</details>

## Command Reference

### Search Command
```bash
semisearch search [OPTIONS] <QUERY>
```

**Common Options:**
- `-p, --path <PATH>` - Where to search (default: current directory)
- `-m, --mode <MODE>` - How to search: semantic, keyword, fuzzy, regex, tfidf, hybrid, auto
- `-l, --limit <N>` - Show only N results (default: 10)
- `-f, --format <FMT>` - Output format: plain or json
- `--context <N>` - Show N lines around each match

**Advanced Options:**
- `-s, --score <0-1>` - Minimum relevance score (default: 0.3)
- `--semantic-threshold <0-1>` - Semantic similarity threshold
- `--case-sensitive` - Match case exactly
- `--typo-tolerance` - Allow typos in matches
- `--files-only` - Show only file paths, not content

### Other Commands

**Index files for faster searching:**
```bash
semisearch index <directory>
```

**Check system status:**
```bash
semisearch status    # Show indexed files and database info
semisearch doctor    # Test system capabilities
semisearch config    # Display configuration
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Neural embeddings unavailable"

This is normal! SemiSearch automatically uses TF-IDF (a statistical method) instead, which still provides good semantic search. To enable neural embeddings:
1. Install ONNX Runtime (see installation guide)
2. Ensure you have at least 4GB RAM
3. Run `semisearch doctor` to verify

### Slow searches

Try these solutions:
1. **Create an index**: `semisearch index ./your-directory`
2. **Search specific folders**: `--path ./src` instead of entire disk
3. **Limit results**: `--limit 20` to get results faster

### No results found

When no matches are found, SemiSearch returns exit code 1 (following Unix conventions like `grep`). Common fixes:
1. **Lower the threshold**: `--score 0.1` (default is 0.3)
2. **Try fuzzy mode**: `--mode fuzzy` for typos
3. **Use simpler queries**: Break complex searches into parts
4. **Check file types**: Binary files are automatically skipped

**Exit Code Reference:**
- `0`: Matches found (success)
- `1`: No matches found or other errors
- `2`: Invalid arguments or command syntax

### Memory issues

For systems with limited RAM:
1. Use `--mode tfidf` or `--mode keyword`
2. Index smaller directories at a time
3. Set `--no-semantic` to disable neural features

## Performance Tips

### Speed Optimization

1. **Always index large directories first:**
   ```bash
   semisearch index ./large-project
   # Subsequent searches will be instant
   ```

2. **Use specific paths:**
   ```bash
   # Slower: searches everything
   semisearch search "function"

   # Faster: searches only src/
   semisearch search "function" --path ./src
   ```

3. **Adjust result limits:**
   ```bash
   # Get top 5 results quickly
   semisearch search "error" --limit 5
   ```

### Memory Optimization

For systems with limited RAM:
```bash
# Use lightweight search modes
semisearch search "query" --mode keyword
semisearch search "query" --mode tfidf

# Disable semantic features
semisearch search "query" --no-semantic
```

## Understanding the Technology

### What is Semantic Search?

Traditional search looks for exact matches. If you search for "car", it only finds "car", not "automobile" or "vehicle".

Semantic search understands meaning. It knows that:
- "car", "automobile", and "vehicle" are related
- "error handling" relates to "exception management"
- "user authentication" connects to "login system"

### How Does It Work?

1. **Text Analysis**: SemiSearch reads your files and breaks them into meaningful chunks
2. **Embedding Generation**: Each chunk is converted into numbers that represent its meaning
3. **Similarity Calculation**: When you search, your query is converted the same way
4. **Smart Matching**: Files with similar number patterns (meanings) are found
5. **Ranking**: Results are sorted by how well they match your intent

### Privacy Guarantees

- **No Internet Required**: Works completely offline after setup
- **No Data Collection**: We don't track searches or results
- **No Cloud Processing**: All AI runs on your computer
- **Open Source**: You can verify the code yourself
