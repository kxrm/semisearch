# SemiSearch - Smart Local File Search

**Find what you're looking for in your files, even when you don't know the exact words.**

SemiSearch is a privacy-focused command-line tool that helps you search through your local files using intelligent text analysis. Unlike traditional search tools that only match exact keywords, SemiSearch understands relationships between words and concepts.

## What Makes SemiSearch Different?

### üß† **Intelligent Text Analysis**
Traditional search tools look for exact word matches. If you search for "car", you won't find documents about "automobile" or "vehicle". SemiSearch uses statistical analysis (TF-IDF) to understand that these words are related and finds them all.

**Example**: Searching for "error handling" will find:
- Code with try/catch blocks  
- Documentation about exception management
- Comments mentioning "error recovery"
- Functions named "handleFailure" or "processException"

### üîí **100% Private**
Everything happens on your computer. No data is sent to the cloud. No AI services are called. Your files stay yours.

### ‚ö° **Works Immediately**
SemiSearch adapts to your system:
- **Any computer**: Statistical text analysis that works great
- **Zero configuration**: Just install and start searching
- **Progressive enhancement**: Advanced features unlock as you learn

## Understanding Search Capabilities

SemiSearch automatically chooses the best search strategy based on your query:

### üéØ **Smart Query Analysis**
The tool automatically detects what kind of search you need:
- **Simple words** ‚Üí Fast keyword search
- **Complex phrases** ‚Üí Intelligent text analysis  
- **Code patterns** ‚Üí Code-aware search
- **Typos detected** ‚Üí Automatic fuzzy matching

### üî§ **Keyword Search**
Traditional exact word matching. Fast and precise.

**When used**: For exact text you know exists (like "TODO" comments)

### üîÄ **Fuzzy Search**  
Handles typos and partial matches.

```bash
semisearch "authentcation" --fuzzy
```

**When used**: When you add `--fuzzy` or when typos are detected

### üìä **TF-IDF Analysis**
Statistical ranking based on word importance and relationships.

**When used**: For conceptual searches like "error handling patterns"

### üìê **Regex Search** (Advanced Mode)
Pattern matching for complex searches.

```bash
semisearch --advanced "user_[0-9]+" --mode regex
```

**When used**: In advanced mode for pattern matching

## How Text Analysis Works

### In Simple Terms

Imagine you're looking for a book in a library:

1. **Traditional search**: You can only find books if you know the exact title
2. **SemiSearch**: A librarian who understands what you're looking for and shows you related books

SemiSearch acts like that smart librarian for your files.

### The Technical Magic

1. **Text Understanding**: SemiSearch reads your files and understands what they're about
2. **Statistical Analysis**: It uses TF-IDF to find relationships between words and concepts
3. **Similarity Matching**: When you search, it finds files with related meanings
4. **Smart Ranking**: Results are sorted by how closely they match your intent

### Privacy-First Approach

- **Local Processing**: All analysis happens on your computer
- **No Cloud Services**: Never sends your data anywhere  
- **Offline Operation**: Works without internet
- **Your Data Stays Yours**: No tracking, no analytics, no external APIs

## Troubleshooting

### No results found

When no matches are found, SemiSearch provides helpful suggestions:
```bash
semisearch "nonexistent"
# Shows: Try different words, check spelling, search broader locations
```

Common fixes:
1. **Try fuzzy search**: `semisearch "query" --fuzzy`
2. **Use simpler terms**: Break complex searches into parts
3. **Check the location**: Make sure you're searching the right directory

### Too many results

SemiSearch automatically provides tips:
```bash
semisearch "function" 
# Shows: "Many results found. Use more specific terms or search in specific folders"
```

Try:
1. **Be more specific**: `semisearch "function validateUser"`
2. **Search specific folders**: `semisearch "TODO" src/`
3. **Use exact phrases**: `semisearch "exact phrase" --exact`

### Slow searches

Speed up searches:
1. **Create an index**: `semisearch index .`
2. **Search specific folders**: `semisearch "query" ./src`
3. **Check system status**: `semisearch doctor`

### Getting Help

SemiSearch provides contextual help based on what you're trying to do:
- **Interactive guidance**: `semisearch help-me`
- **System status**: `semisearch status`
- **Detailed diagnostics**: `semisearch doctor`
- **Command reference**: `semisearch --help`

## Performance & Capabilities

### Speed Optimization

   # Subsequent searches will be much faster
   ```

2. **Use specific paths**:
   ```bash
   # Faster: searches only src/
   semisearch "function" src/
   ```

3. **Leverage automatic optimization**:
   - SemiSearch automatically chooses the fastest method for your query
   - Simple searches use fast keyword matching
   - Complex searches use statistical analysis
